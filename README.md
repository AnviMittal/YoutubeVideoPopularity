# YoutubeVideoPopularity

Through this project, our goal was to explore patterns in YouTube video trends. Our main aim was to identify key factors influencing the popularity of a video, such as title length, engagement rates and timing of publication. We achieved this by analysing data sets from ten countries and carried it out in Python using libraries like pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

We cleaned our data by removing columns that were irrelevant to our goal and filtering out videos with minimal engagement. We also merged country-specific datasets as part of our data cleaning process. We created new variables like engagement rate, title length and binary indicators to classify videos that had more dislikes than likes. These steps helped to support our analysis.

Our results showed significant variations in viewership across different genres. We also found that title length impacted viwership and reach of videos and publishing time impacts popularity of videos. Videos with more dislikes than likes were rare but they gave us insight into negative reactions from audiences.

These findings highlight the cultural and behavioral differences that drive the dynamic content ecosystem of Youtube which offers us a deeper understanding of global content consumption. Focus of future research can entail sentiment analysis or platform driven algorithmic influences.
